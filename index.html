        </div>
        <div class="bio1">
            <p>the sci-fi version:</p>
            <p>In the year 2178, Daphne K. Lee was posthumously awarded The Halo Prize for intergalactic achievement.
                The
                president from planet Earth, Daphne’s hometown, accepted the award on her behalf. The Halo Prize
                commemorates Daphne’s journey orbiting Earth. Between 2016 and 2020, Daphne roamed through various
                continents and documented her travel via photography, an early art form that captured still images. She
                settled in cities like Medellín and Taipei temporarily, and dedicated much of her time to journalism, a
                now
                defunct communication medium.</p>
            <p>After orbiting Earth, her persistent wanderlust pushed her to explore the outer space. She was the first
                of
                her kind to reach the outer edges of our galaxy, which we now take for granted.</p>
            <p>A monument has now been erected at the rest stop by Exit 11C on the intergalactic highway to celebrate
                her
                life. Salute.</p>
            <p><i>A cool <a href="https://sricola.com">friend</a> wrote this awesome bio. Edited by Daphne. If you’re
                    reading this in 2021, she’s still alive, writing in New York City.</i></p>

            <p>the earthly version:</p>
            <p>Daphne K. Lee is a New York-based journalist covering food and culture. She often uses a popular dish or
                a
                trending tv show to discuss social issues including racism, cultural stereotypes, and censorship. Her
                bylines can be found on CBS News, VICE, Nikkei Asia, Goldthread, among others. But she may be best known
                for
                introducing the viral term “revenge bedtime procrastination” to a global audience. </p>
